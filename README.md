# java-applets
A few applets I made in school (Be proud of me pls, I made these barely months after learning what a loop was)

Mine Sweeper: (cause I too was young and thought being good at minesweeper meant you were smart)
Using the mouse you can select tiles (Left CLick to flag). The game has three difficulty modes.

Tank Battle: (forgive the ugly graphics, unfortunately I am not very good at Microsoft Paint)
Made it to learn how to let two players control things on screen at the same time.

Flappy Bird: The very first applet I made. Also the ugliest and buggiest but its my baby so it gets to go here
